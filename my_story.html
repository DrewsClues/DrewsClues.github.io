      <h1 class="profile_header">How I came to Programming:</h1>

      <h4 class="profile_subheader">Trouble With Excel</h4>
      
      <p class = "profile_paragraph">
        So, it was Fall 2019 and I was a few months into my first job out of University, teaching English at an academy in Gwangmyeong, South Korea. Although I majored in Geology in University, for numerous reasons I wasn’t too sure about pursuing it as a career. I had studied abroad at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea in 2016 and really fallen in love with the city and made some amazing friendships. So, returning to Korea to teach seemed like a perfect thing to do while I did some soul searching. A few months in and things were nice, my coworkers and students were great and I was half an hour’s subway ride from some of my best friends. Although work was going well for me there were a few tedious duties that I disliked. The major one being lesson plans, every month we had to download and modify excel sheets from a server for each of our classes. There was a lot of repetitive clicking, copying and pasting, and editing cells which frankly seemed very slow and inefficient. As time went on, I became oddly fixated on the lesson plans. I kept thinking there had to be a faster way. In my spare time I did some tinkering with excel and ended up coming up with a pretty good system that did ALMOST everything I wanted to. However, it couldn’t do everything, and while searching for a solution online I discovered the only way to accomplish what I wanted was to code it. Big problem was, I didn’t know how to code. But smart people write code, I’m a smart person so I figured why not me too?

      <h4 class="profile_subheader"> Learning Python</h4>

      <p class = "profile_paragraph">
        As I had never written a line of code before, I had to do some research on where to begin. After looking around online for advice I decided to start learning Python, as it seemed to be widely used and beginner friendly. Right away I got really into it and my interest went far beyond my original lesson plan issue. Every morning I would get up early and study in coffee shops before work, espresso and PyCharm became a ritual basically. It was fun experimenting with different libraries and following along with tutorials online. Everything from how to program video games with Pygame, or using regular expressions for text replacement. It was exhilarating to be learning such a cool new skill, especially one that I always found intimidating to look at. Although fun, it wasn't easy at all, there were times when I felt very discouraged. Whenever I did become frustrated, I always reminded myself that you can either suffer in boredom or in pursuit of something difficult and worthwhile. I was having fun with YouTube tutorials, and little projects of my own but I will admit I didn’t have a clear direction. My ever-pragmatic father, an engineer himself in the IT world, would often press me about what my endgame was and where I was taking this new pursuit. He encouraged me to look into Data Science as it is an important and growing field and Python is used heavily by Data Scientists.

      <h4 class="profile_subheader"> Data Science</h4>

      <p class = "profile_paragraph">
        In March 2020, during the midst of Covid-19 lockdowns I signed up for the Data Quest learning platform at my father’s suggestion.  It was nice to be grounded in a more structured program and have a clearer path in my learning. I enjoyed working on projects such as the famous Titanic Data Set, and obscure things like car sales on German Ebay. I gained valuable skills with Jupyter notebooks, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib as well as some familiarity with SQL. I had some fun with my own little pursuits as well, such as writing a script that combed through thousands of Korea Herald News articles and returned a percentage of those which referenced North Korea, a random idea for which I never would have had the capacity before. A few months into my Data Science program I decided that I wanted to take a break and explore other technologies which led me to Udemy.

      <h4 class="profile_subheader"> AWS & Machine Learning</h4>

      <p class = "profile_paragraph">
        I had heard of Cloud Computing before but beyond it being a hot up and coming technology I knew little about it. It was only once I had made my foray into programming that I decided I wanted to take a look. Via Udemy I purchased an AWS solutions architect course, which I found particularly fascinating. I had known little of servers and networks, let alone in the cloud. I ploughed through the course with a great deal of enthusiasm and shortly after was recommended another class on Machine Learning. At that point I was all for things that sounded intimidating and complex so I jumped in. These days you hear the terms “AI” and “Machine Learning” get thrown around all the time in popular discourse so it was quite exhilarating to gain insight into how they work and the ideas behind them. On the side of my Udemy classes I worked on lots of side projects, such as partially automating monthly reports for my job, utilizing Python’s tkinter library for user interface and gspread to fetch data from my google drive.

      <h4 class="profile_subheader"> Full Stack Developer</h4>

      <p class = "profile_paragraph">
        In August 2020 I began a new teaching job in the Gangnam district of Seoul which I where I live and work now. Around that time, I decided that I wanted to pursue more formalized education and to commit to an area of specialization. It wasn’t until December that I discovered and settled on MITxpro’s full stack developer program. The curriculum of Javascript, HTML, and CSS looked interesting and like a great way to gain a solid and job ready foundation in programming. So here I am now in week 11 of the program building my very first website. A long way from my humble beginnings fumbling with excel. I’m really grateful for all the knowledge I’ve gained since then and excited for all the new knowledge and skills I’ll gain moving forward.
