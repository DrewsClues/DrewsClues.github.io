          <p class="profile_paragraph"> This project was assigned during week 7 of my Full Stack developer program. The focus of week 7 was manipulation of the DOM and dynamically injecting JavaScript into HTML pages. This project is essentially a factory for Pacmen. Pacmen are created on screen and then begin moving at random speeds. The Pacmen are programmed to check for the edges of the page and reverse directions.   </p>
          <h1 class= "project_header">How To Use</h1>
          <p class="profile_paragraph"> To use the program, click the link to my repository and download all the files into one folder, open the index.html file in a browser window. Click the "Add PacMan" button add Pacmen to the screen. Then click the "Start Game" button to begin the animation. </p>

          <p class="profile_paragraph"> This project was assigned during week 9 of my Full Stack developer program. The focus of week 9 was asynchronous programming, fetching data from URLS, and working with map animations. This program displays a World Map, using the Map Box service, which automatically centers on Boston. The program then fetches gps coordinates of a bus on Boston's Bus Route 1 from the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority). The location of the bus is displayed via a marker and is then updated every 15 seconds. </p>

          <p class="profile_paragraph"> To run this program click the link to my repository, download the files and place in a folder together. Then drag and drop the index.html file to a browser. Click on the "Update Bus Route 1" button to begin tracking the bus. </p>
